Module 21 Challenge: Utilizing neural networks with TensorFlow on Google Colab

### Overview
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

### Results
Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:
*   Initial attempts lead to a training accuracy no greater that 73%.
*   Additional data from the original dataset was required to puch the accuracy greater than 75%. 
*   The training loss and accuracy with the 'NAMES' included feature hovered around 41% and 78% repectfully
*   There was a trend towards overfitting as the number of epochs increased


### Data Preprocessing

##### **Model 1**

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
